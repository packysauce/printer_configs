# A place to keep my printer configs because I keep screwing them up
"Remember kids, the only difference between Science and screwing around is writing it down."

# Printers

- Amy "ai3ms" - Anycubic i3 Mega S
 - Original hardware, but the board is an Octopus

- Bender the Ender (...3 Pro)
 - Mostly original
 - printed [ProperPrinting's Quick changer for it](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3369444)
 - BTT SKR2 (I accidentally put a BLTouch in 5V mode and blew the 3.3v regulator on the 4.2.2 board)
