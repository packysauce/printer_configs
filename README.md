"Remember kids, the only difference between Science and screwing around is writing it down."

# Printers

- Amy "ai3ms" - Anycubic i3 Mega S
 - ~~Original hardware~~, but the board is an Octopus
  - what have i done??

- Bender the Ender (...3 Pro)
 - Mostly original, second Z screw
 - BTT SKR2 (I accidentally put a BLTouch in 5V mode and blew the 3.3v regulator on the 4.2.2 board)
